      <p><br>A little about me: <br><br> I am 20 years old and I'm from Libertyville Illinois. I have 
      lived in 8 different homes across 5 different states throughout my life. Interestingly enough, 
      my parents actually just moved to Colorado, where I used to live 
      when I was in elementary school. <br> <br> I have two brothers, one older and one younger. The
      older one, Jacob, graduated from Michigan in 2019 with a degree in computer science. He know works
      for Google in Boulder, CO. My younger brother, Chuck, is also in Boulder as he is a student at CU. 
      My dad works in marketing for a pharmaceutical company in Santa Monica. My mom is a special needs
      teacher at the school I grew up going to in Golden, CO. <br> <br> My brothers and I all fell in 
      love with soccer growing up. Chuck and I both support Manchester United and Jacob supports Arsenal. 
      Neither club is doing well right so nobody has much to brag about. We all played throughout 
      our whole childhood. I got lucky enough to keep playing into my adult life at the University of 
      Michigan. However, Jacob won a state championship with his high school team and I unfortunately 
      lost two state championships with my high school team (one year with Chuck on the squad with me). 
      Jacob uses that as his claim to fame that he's etter then I would ever be.
